probability density function : 

are used to describe distributions like continuous uniform distribution, normal distribution, Student t distribution. The probability density function gives the probability that the value of a random variable will fall between a range of values. A cumulative distribution function and the probability density function are used to describe a continuous distribution.


Types of Probability Density Function :


1. Normal Distribution

2. Standard Normal Distribution

3. Student - t Distribution

4. Chi-Square Distribution

5. Continuous Uniform Distribution
